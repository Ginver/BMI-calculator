# BMI-calculator

### Challenge 1 / Create a BMI calculator

### Challenge 2 / Create a BMR calculator

var age = readline.questionInt("How old are you (years)?")
var sex = readline.question("What is your sex?")
var activityLevel = readline.question("What is your activity level? (Sedentary? / Moderately Active? / Active? / Very active?")

### Challenge 3 / Diet plan

Create a diet plan for the user by:
- Taking their total calories and subtracting 500 this is the suggested intake
- Calculate the weight they will be in 5, 10 and 15 weeks
	BMI | 18.5 - 24.9  | Normal  
	BMI = weight / (height * height)
	weight = BMI / weight * height * 100

1 kg of body fat is approximately 7700 calories. 
That means that by cutting expending 500 more calories than you eat you can lose almost 0.5 kg in a week

Output the plan: the suggested intake and their weight goals for 5, 10 and 15 weeks.
